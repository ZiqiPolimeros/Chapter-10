9. Look at the following interface: 
public interface Computable 
{
   double compute(double x);
}  
Write a statement that uses a lambda expression to create an object 
that implements the Computable interface. 
The object’s name should be half. 
The half object’s compute method should return the value of the x parameter divided by 2.
